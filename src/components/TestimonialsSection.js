Brandon has been working with Scrapit, the MIT-based startup I co-founded, as the Lead Developer and he consistently impresses with his ability to build rapidly with an eye for detail, all while maintaining a lens on the big picture of what the product has to deliver.</p>
            <p className="testimonial-content">Brandon is an extremely quick learner and has a passion for high-quality work that shines through. I think that his ability to learn while building is one of the most important qualities to look for in a strong developer, and he absolutely nails it. He is also a great, collaborative teammate with a strong sense of ownership over his workâ€“anyone ought to be thrilled to have him join their team!"</p>
